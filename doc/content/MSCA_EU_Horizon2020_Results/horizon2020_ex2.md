This page details how to obtain homogeneous solutions of BFO for the structural and spin order. The first calculation is independent of the second but the second requires information of the first. This is because the magnetic system does not appreciably influence the relaxation dynamics of the polarization since the work required to move ions (i.e. those relative displacements corresponding to $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{A}$) is much larger than those to reorient the Fe spins.
