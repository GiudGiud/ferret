Within the scope of the [Project SCALES - 897614](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/897614), the idea was to develop a new continuum approach for simulation of multiferroic compounds.  Multiferroics are a class of materials which display both an electric and magnetic ordering below their critical phase transition. Specifically, we use the perovskite $\mathrm{BiFeO}_3$ (BFO) as our material workhorse. BFO displays both ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism at room temperature, leading to a host of possible applications from beyond-CMOS logic gates, tunneling magnetoresistant spintronic valves, THz radiation emitters, enhanced piezoelectric elements, ultrafast acoustic modulators, to linear electrooptical components. To study these materials at the continuum scale in this project, we proposed to couple the phase field method for studying ferroelectrics with the micromagnetic approach. The idea was to have self-consistently the same time and length scale for both electric and magnetic order unlocking the magnetoelectric coupling in both static or dynamic configurations (i.e. switching or spin-wave transport) in a scalable open-source code.

In order to disseminate results to the public in the framework of the H2020-MSCA-IF-2019 call, this additional page was added to the FERRET website. We will discuss background and the model, summarize our key findings, and provide examples of how to reproduce the results obtained during the funding period and described in our article [!cite](Mangeri2023).

Stay tuned for an update!
