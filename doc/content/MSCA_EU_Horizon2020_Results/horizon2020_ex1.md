This page details how to obtain hohomogeneous solutions of BFO for the structural and spin order. The first calculation is independent of the second but the second requires information of the first. This is because the magnetic system does not appreciably influence the relaxation dynamics of the polarization since the work required to move ions (i.e. those relative displacements corresponding to $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{A}$) is much larger than those to reorient the Fe spins.

This project [SCALES - 897614](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/897614) was funded for 2021-2023 at the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu/) under principle investigator [Jorge Íñiguez](https://sites.google.com/site/jorgeiniguezresearch/). The research was carried out within the framework of the [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action (H2020-MSCA-IF-2019)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/msca-if-2020) fellowship.
