!alert construction title=Undocumented Class
The MicroforceWallEnergy has not been documented. The content listed below should be used as a starting point for
documenting the class, which includes the typical automatic documentation associated with a
MooseObject; however, what is contained is ultimately determined by what is necessary to make the
documentation clear for users.

!syntax description /AuxKernels/MicroforceWallEnergy

## Overview

Computes the microforce due to the gradient free energy density $f_\mathrm{grad}$,

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\delta f_\mathrm{grad}}{\delta \mathbf{P}} = \frac{\partial f_\mathrm{grad}}{\partial \mathbf{P}} - \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}}\cdot \left(\frac{\partial f_\mathrm{grad}}{\partial \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{P}}{\partial \mathbf{r}}}\right)\right)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
