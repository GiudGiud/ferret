Please cite [!cite](Mangeri2017) if you use FERRET. A methods and benchmarking publication is in the works which will supersede this requirement in the future. We invite the community to contribute to this effort. You may contact one of the developers if you are interested.

# Contribute

There are many aspects of ferroics or other electronic phenomena (i.e. piezo- and thermoelectricity) that are not currently implemented in FERRET. We aim to expand the capabilities of this module extensively in the future. As such, *ANY* contribution to our code base is welcome! Please consult our documentation or contact the developers for help with code changes.

# Thank you!

A special thanks for all of the collaborators of the various [`projects`](publication_highlights/publication_highlights.md) using FERRET.

We also would like to thank the code contributors and developers from Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for their continued support.
