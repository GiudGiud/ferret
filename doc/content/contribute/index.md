The developers of FERRET are

- John Mangeri: john.m.mangeri@gmail.com
- Olle Heinonen: olle.heinonen@seagate.com
- Lukasz Kuna: lukasz.kuna.ctr@nrl.navy.mil

We ask that you cite [!cite](Mangeri2017) if you use FERRET. A corresponding BibTeX entry is:

```tex
@article{Mangeri2017,
  title={Topological phase transformations and intrinsic size effects in ferroelectric nanoparticles},
  author={Mangeri, John and Espinal, Yomery and Jokisaari, Andrea and Alpay, S. Pamir and Nakhmanson, Serge and Heinonen, Olle},
  journal={Nanoscale},
  volume={9},
  pages={1616-1624},
  year={2017},
  publisher={Royal Chemical Society}
}
```
A methods and benchmarking publication is in the works which will supersede this request in the future. We invite the community to contribute to this effort. You may contact one of the developers if you are interested. It also should be mentioned that you should also quote the relevant MOOSE papers in your publication if you use certain MOOSE objects or protocols (which you are). See [here](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/citing.html).

# Contribute

There are many aspects of ferroics or other electronic phenomena (i.e. piezo- and thermoelectricity) that are not currently implemented in FERRET. We aim to expand the capabilities of this module extensively in the future. As such, *ANY* contribution to our code base is welcome! Please consult our documentation or contact the developers for help with code changes.

# Thank you!

A special thanks for all of the collaborators/co-authors of the various [`projects`](publication_highlights/publication_highlights.md) using FERRET.

We also would like to thank the code contributors and developers from Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for their continued support.
