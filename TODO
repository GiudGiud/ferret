LIST OF THINGS TO DO:

1.) petsc 3.6 for cluster (install super-LU dist, parmetis, metis USE git clone)

2.) Why is Jacobian wrong for displacement time dependence? -- all kernels on except FerroelectricCouplingU

3.) Fix FE problem -- turn off full = true, does it reproduce results?

4.) Why do we have zero pivot for no displacement time dependent/FerroelectricCouplingU?

An initial condtion of random displacements seems to fix this problem.

5.) tensor_mechanics -- add in-plane constant strain for entire block. -- rewrite the elastic energy post processor

This is fine now. Need the ComputeSmallStrain block and the AuxKernel blocks from before. Pulling ~1nm on each side for 40nm block induces about 5% strain for the slab.

6.) Why is ferroelectricU jacobian off?

7.) Redo the JUST fe problem in the new hecto/femto/nano HFT units.
