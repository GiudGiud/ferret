#sbrick:
# This test stretches a cube vertically. The top and bottom surfaces are forced to maintain 
# their shape by prescribing zero X and Y displacements, hence, it is clamped in XY, or laterally.
# The mesh here is small, facilitating direct examination of the resulting vectors and matrices.
# Whenever a matrix is formed, we use -pc_type svd.  For a matrix-free  matrix -pc_type none is used, 
# where appropriate.
#brick: 
#Same as sbrick on the same mesh, except uniformly refined 2 times.
#This tests whether the findings of sbrick test are mesh-size dependent.
