These are test cases for the stretched brick problem (sbrick).
sbrick0.2|4.asm|gamg[0].left|right

We apply only Z-displacements at the top and the bottom, resulting
in a singular problem with a three-dimensional nullspace: Z-rotation
as well as X- and Y-displacements. The '0' in 'sbrick0' significes
the presence of this nullspace.

The initial mesh is refined uniformly 2 or 4 times, hence
the choice 2|4 in the file name.

We use ASM (with overlap 1 and lu on the blocks) or the GAMG preconditioner.
Hence, the choice asm|gamg.  We can remove or not the nullspace.  The 
runs with the nullspace (i.e., without removal) are designated as asm0 or gamg0.
(Note that in order to remove the nullspace we declare it in the input file,
so the files WITH the nullspace declaration (not to be confused with GAMG's NEARnullspace)
are actually the runs WITHOUT the nullspace in the problem (as it is removed)).

We use either left or right preconditioning, as the convergence behavior can change 
substantially.  Hence the choice left|right in the file name.
Switching from left to right preconditioning is done in 
petsc options: -ksp_pc_side left or -ksp_pc_side right.
Right preconditioning generally results in identical
linear and nonlinear residuals, while for left preconditioning
they can vary substantially.
